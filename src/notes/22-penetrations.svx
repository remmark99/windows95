# 22 Penetrations

Did you know you're more popular than you think? Well, not *you* - your server with an open port 22. 

Let's play a game. Run this:
```sh
# Sends your credit card information to hackers
sudo lastb | wc - l 
```
If your number is bigger than mine, you win.

*My score - yours is probably worse*

Wait, you "won"? Congrats! That means over *18317* random Algerian kids (speaking from personal experience) tried to SSH into your server. And that's just from <span className="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500">3 DAYS</span> of leaving port 22 open.

## What Now?

<s>Burn your server, flee to the Amazon, and live off-grid. Hackers can't touch you if you're a hermit.</s>

*Just change your ssh port.* Everyone and their mama is trying to connect via port 22, but no one is going to try connect via a port that is same to your CVC (*unless it's 022*).

### I. First, let's edit your ssh configuration file:
```sh
# Opens the file without the possibility of closing it
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Simply add a new line with your desired port:

*4-th line from bottom or 14-th line from top if you can't count from bottom*

### II. Restart SSH:
```sh
sudo service ssh restart
```

### III. Oops, the Firewall Blocked You ðŸ˜­
Well, tough luck, kid. I ain't that smart to know how to do that, so you're on your own.
